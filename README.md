# Grayscaled pictures colorisation  

Homework for the 2018 BME VIK Deep learning course.

I choosed the IMG01 problem: Grayscaled image colorisation.
There is a sample folder with all the files my program will use up, just these samples smaller than their original sizes.
In this work i am using up the pretrained Keras VGG16 network for a part of my model.

## Prerequisites  
You can use up the requirements.txt to create your environment. (it contains a cpu tensorflow)
Jupyter notebook  for the .ipynb files.
Opencv2 for video colorization.  
NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN  

## Getting Started

###
data_collector.py methods are collecting and forming the downloaded Google image set .csv-s.  
image_loader.py loading up the downloaded images, separate datasets.
